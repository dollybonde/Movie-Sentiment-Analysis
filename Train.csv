Maggie L,True,2019-08-18,3.0,"I think that they should‚Äôve brought back more of the original voice actors, This movie is so iconic and So important to so many people... I don‚Äôt think they did it any justice the way it is.  If they had created an entirely new story with the kind of computer generated animals that were in the lion King they would have had an amazing movie but, the way it is now it was kind of disappointing",False
Bryan A,True,2019-08-18,5.0,"Great, absolutely great!  The animation was great, the story line spot on and Beyonc√© delivered.  A little more violence than the animated version but that was expected.  Overall - loved it.",False

Sheena,True,2019-08-18,3.0,I didn‚Äôt like Beyonc√© being nala. Bad acting. I didn‚Äôt like that they kept some things out. I didn‚Äôt like some of the stuff that they added was unnecessary. It‚Äôs a very good classic no need to try to fix or change something that is very nostalgic to childhood memories. So for me it was more of a 2.5 rating.,False

J,True,2019-08-18,0.5,Animation was good. Nearly every line was the exact same as the old movie though so its very boring. Besides the way the movie looks it is the exact same.

Also, star off because remakes involving animals don‚Äôt go over as well as humans. Aladdin allowed you to better immerse yourself, since there were humans you could connect with.

I was waiting to see it since it was announced that it was going out, I saw the trailer and the emotion was great but at the moment of seeing it the feeling was different. I felt that it was not what I expected.
I will not deny that the effects and the music were incredible, but I do not know why but the plot did not convince me. I felt that I had seen another movie and not THE LION KING.
It would have been nice if this movie would have looked a little closer to the original. I think that I would have enjoyed it more.

Brian,True,2019-08-17,5.0,"The new Lion King remake is phenomenal!! I personally LOVED the new Lion King. I actually like it just as much as the original if not more. I think Jon Favreau is a creative genius in his visionary take on projects. Unfortunately Disney got the Lion King right the first time, which didn‚Äôt necessitate a remake. Which is why 90% of the original had been untouched for the 2019 version. HOWEVER... I think Favreau‚Äôs brilliance will really come through if they get him to make a Lion King 2. The original is impossible to beat. But the sequels and spinoffs are much less memorable for MOST fans, yet still provide an excellent foundation for someone like Favreau to take it and really make it something special. Just like he did with Jungle Book. Jungle Book had plenty of room for creative reimagining because it‚Äôs not as widely memorable, which is where he could take liberties that he simply didn‚Äôt have with Lion King. I honestly think that the remake we got is by far the best possible job any director could‚Äôve done with the scope of the task at hand. Excellent work and it deserves every dollar and accolade that it‚Äôs earning as we speak!! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!!",False

Connie,True,2019-08-17,4.0,"The film setting in South Africa and the live animals makes this an even more dramatic, moving story than the original animation although a bit more scary for younger children. Portraying the eat or be eaten rules of the wild were hinted at rather than depicted- no blood in the final fight scene. The comedic warthog relieved the great loss and loneliness of Simba.",False

Avant S,False,2019-08-17,2.5,Modern technology and all the motion graphics are all cool and stuff but did we really need to watch the same story frame to frame? probably not. Original lion king will always have something the newer version lacks. which is emotion. ,False

Grandpa,False,2019-08-17,1.5,"I just went to the Cinemark Howard Hughes theatre near here to watch The Lion King. Children in the audience were verbally happy to be there.

From minute one, Lion King demonstrated the awesome master combination of Disney filmmaking technics far beyond Walt Disney graphics beginnings.

A scene or two later into the story, a mean aggressive hyena suddenly pops up from the shadows threatening our innocent heroes in the story. 
Unfortunately, the scene was shockingly racial. 
The audiovisual was too overt to escape my sensibilities. 
The hyena was black. Hyenas are generally tan or grey. Not black. You could blame it on the lighting but the hyena was black.

In fact, it appears that the mean hyena was crafted to emulate a black person. Furthermore, its voice over sounded like a black man. 

Of course the little children in the audience had no clue they were being brainwashed.

Lion King storyline attempted the proverbial Joseph Campbell mono-myth dramatic curve.  They even had the cleansing rain at the end but it was no help to improve the  distasteful bathroom humor.
Lion King failed to sustain the tit-for-tat excitement of Disney yesteryears movies. 

A shameless, shamefull racial movie.",True

Mani P,False,2019-08-17,0.5,"The Lion King is a 2019 remake of the 1994 Disney classic The Lion King. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, and stars Donald Glover as Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar.

The film in my opinion is a disgrace to the original film, from the emotionless character expressions to the dreadful and unfitting voice acting.

The story was basically the same as the original (nearly down to the beat), but for some reason it felt a lot less epic and not nearly as intriguing or emotional.

The voice acting I found to be stale and dry, from the lack of care in the actors voices to the bland and weary line delivery; one voice actor in particular was Shahadi Wright Joseph as (child) Simba, I found that the performance he gave was really lacking in key areas like emotion and timing.

The characters were basically just the same as the original, so I don't really have much to say here.

The animation may be extremely realistic and detailed, but what angers me most is that because of the realism the animals and characters couldn't express as much emotion as they did in the original film.

The colour scheme was also very dark and grey, which in my opinion takes away from the atmosphere and scale of the film.

The soundtrack was also a huge let down from the original film, from Beyonc√© and Donald Glover's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (which takes place in the day) to the addition of Beyonc√©'s song Spirit.

The emotion and relationships in the film were also a lot less gripping, especially the relationship between Simba and Mufasa.

The film I also found to be really bland and uninteresting, but what makes it worse is that the original film was really interesting and had a very strong style to it.

Over all I give it a 
1/10 - would never recommend

A shallow and heartless product which should have never been made.",False
nmh,True,2019-08-17,3.0,The way the movie built was great but I think the CGI didn‚Äôt really capture the emotions of each character compare to original one and all I can see was their mouth open.There are few parts that I like but overall the cartoon is better.,False

Gary,True,2019-08-17,3.5,"The movie was well done, however I did not like the fact that the story line was identical to the cartoon classic.  I incorrectly assumed it would be slightly different like the Aladdin live action remake was.  The slight differences in Aladdin were enough to keep me interested throughout.",False
Sheryl,True,2019-08-17,5.0,Fantastic job on animation of the characters,False
Langston,True,2019-08-17,4.0,"I liked how they remade and kept original scenes from the cartoon animated film. It truly made you get some nostalgic feelings from watching that opening. I think some of the voice acting was off and the casting couldve been a bit better for at least two characters, but thats most likely just my bias towards the original cinematic film. I also realized they did this for the live action purpose, but I disliked the removal of some iconic scenes and actions from specific characters. Some parts from the 1st movie really added depth to characters and helped the audience really laugh or feel the intensity of a characters thoughts, ideas, plans. Again I know they removed a chunk of these things for live action purposes to fit in with realistic actions, but its hard not to mention either. All in all it was a good reminder of how original The Lion King was back in the day and shows us things that couldve been done differently in some aspects.",False
Ally B,False,2019-08-17,2.0,"Surprisingly, I didn't hate this movie as much as I thought I would. I liked some of the changes and to be honest, Timon and Puumba stole the show. They got a few laughs out of me and I was excited whenever they were on screen.

But unfortunately there's some not so great things with this movie. A lot of the voice acting felt like I was watching a community theatre play, which is sad because I really like a lot of the voice actors in this movie. While the animation is great and looks realistic, I think it takes away from the performance because the animals aren't allowed to show much emotion. The story in this one felt very rushed and they added some pretty pointless scenes. It feels very lacking and doesn't have near as much heart as the original.",False
Kriss K,False,2019-08-17,3.5,I enjoyed this film very much. The CGI in this film is incredible and it does a good job at adapting a classic. There are some things that make the animated film better but you really can't compare an animated film to a CGI one especially CGI done to look real. This is not easy to achieve folks where as animators draw these(CGI) effects take months if not years to create a realistic image,False

Kevin R,True,2019-08-17,4.0,"This movie is tough to rate, it is technically brilliant, but seems to fail at capturing the spirit of the animated version. Seeing photorealistic animals talking is a little disturbing. Also animal faces don't show human like  emotion. The animals look as if they were photographed on the plains , they are brilliant.

In fact, I'd say most of these Disney remakes were never meant for live-action. They were meant to be animated family fun for everyone.

Even though we both knew the storyline backwards and forwards we were totally sucked in from beginning to end. There were times that I personally felt anxious, like I didn't know what was going to happen. I'm glad we didn't bring his little sister (7 years-old, but very sensitive) as she would have been scared during several parts. My son and I had both heard not-so-great reviews, so we were on the lookout for negatives but neither of us walked away with any negatives to talk about.

I will say that this is a better outing than most of what we've gotten so far, mostly because the movie is so alike to the original.  I think the best improvement though is the hyenas are given more of a menacing role than the joke that they were in the original.

Some of the songs also had to be heavily restrained due to hyper-realistic restrictions, such as Scars ""Be Prepared"" song.

The scenery was lush and beautiful for the most part, I found the main characters heartwarming, and the interplay between Simba and his father both loving and stern when he explained the dangers when he disobeyed him were convincing for me.  Of course the comic moments were truly scene stealing. I washappen to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasah and there were mystic qualities with Rafeki, The death of Mufasah was was much more dramatic and darker than the original which I naturally expected and I will admit it, I cried!!!

anonymous  s,False,2019-08-14,2.5,"okay, first of all, I would like to say somethings that need to be said about the critics that aren't giving it fair reviews.
First, the reason why games like call of duty and FIFA get high reviews are that a lot of critics are not allowed to make a direct compare to others in a series you can make small parts saying like the characters cannot show emotion like the cartoon but you cannot flat out say the first film better therefor this film was bad.
now on to my review 
_________________________________________________
due to them trying to be realistic it did affect some parts of the movie mostly singing and showing emotion what I mean by this is the singing isn't as clean as you would think the characters sound more like Les Mis where they are more talking through the music and more noise from background fx I don't think many people would like to hear big splash sounds after every step in a song if they are in water oddly it didn't happen in every song just a few 
now with how the characters show emotion oddly, they didn't do a bad job I would say but  some characters have the blank face though the whole movie. They manage to get the lions and hyenas to show a lot more than others.
Shouldn't really need to talk about the story not much change in it 
I would say this movie wasn't the greatest but there wasn't anything bad in it it was a lot more in the middle for me. It isn't a second watch  for me anytime soon but enjoyable I would say

The cinematography is beautiful, the graphics are life-like, but some of the voice acting felt weak.  Donald Glover was great, James Earl Jones is great as we can expect, but I felt Ejiofor, while an incredible actor I've loved in other flicks, didn't have the level of menace Scar held in the original.  This being said, I think the change to Be Prepared, being made like a pre-battle speech for war was genius and Ejiofor NAILS that particular part.  The additional characters for Simba's time growing up with Timon and Pumba felt unnecessary, and some of the changes to Rafiki's part before Simba sees ""who he is"" felt less engaging than the animated original - but honestly all of this is nit-picking.  I enjoy the film and it felt worth the price of admission.",False

Additionally the CGI made for fantastic models of animals but failed in giving them facial expressions.

The voice acting was bland, dry, and did not make up for the lack of emotion realistic characters needed. I would take the original voice acting, put it over top since its almost scene for scene, and cut out the unnecessary bits (Like Scar basically becoming an incel because Sarabi chose Mufasa over him) And you would have a perfect, photo-realistic carbon copy.

Jason M,False,2019-08-13,3.5,"	Lion King
	Initial Reaction: How is this going to be different than the cartoon version?
	Main Characters
	Simba, Nala: Two lions voiced by Donald Glover and Beyonce
	TImon, Pumbaa: A meerkat/warthog combo voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen

	Plot Summary (for those who didn't see the animated film)
	Lions rule the land where the movie takes place.  The king and queen just brought in their newest baby, Simba.
	But their brother (or brother in law),Scar (with a name like that, how can he NOT be evil?), schemes to get the throne.  Using the help of the hyenas, he gets the kign killed and Simba ousted out of the kingdom.
	But the lion cub gets some help from a warthog and a meerkat, then the spirit of his dead father, then his ""friend"", Nala.

SCORING
	Main Characters
	The main characters most of us know and love are here and they are just as good and we remember them.  SCORE: 9

	Supporting Cast
	They give Nala a bit more personality because, well, she's the leading lady.  Still, we get some good moments from a baboon, a bird and the hyenas themselves.  SCORE: 8

	Plot
	The plot is easy to follow, and it has a few nice twists.  But they add a few new scenes that felt more like padding.  SCORE: 6

	Originality
	This particular Disney remake does the least changes to the animated version ‚Äì which makes me wonder why make the live action in the first place (other than to show off some impressive CGI.  SCORE: 3

	Violence Factor
	There's a lot of fights between lions and hyenas (I thought I was watching a nature documentary during those fights).  But the fights do get a tiring.  SCORE: 7

	Other Moral Issues

Jack W,False,2019-08-13,3.5,"Found this computer-generated remake to be an entertaining on the whole with a few caveats.

The movie looks so amazing and photo-realistic. The background in particular is really impressive, I'm surprised this film had only one real setting shot. You really can't tell the difference between this landscape and the real world. Director John Favreau (Iron Man; Jungle Book) has some interesting shots in this. At times, the movie feels like a nature documentary.

Plotwise, this is probably the least ambitious of the recent Disney remakes. Unlike Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which clung to the plot structure of the originals but also added new elements, this one just retells the basic story. Still, I'm not hating it. This isn't the 90's Psycho. It's not word-by-word. What works for me here is that the jokes are almost all new and they work really well.

Cast is decent. All the funny characters jive. Donald Glover as adult Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar do a good job as the hero and villain. However, Beyonce as adult Nala sometimes really comes across as reading off the page without a whole lot of effort.

The background music really sells the scenes, but admittedly Hans Zimmer basically just rehashes the music from the first film.

This contains all the classic songs from the original. However, ""Be Prepared"" has been changed to a half-it's-length spoken word song with reworked lyrics. I know at one point the news was that they were cutting this song. (Either for time or Ejiofor just didn't have the pipes.) I'm guessing this was added back due to the backlash but modified to accomodate either or both of the potential issues just mentioned. I actually would've preferred if they left the song out rather than going with this neutered version, which doesn't quite work.

If you feel that the recent Disney remakes are soulless cashgrabs, this really won't be the one to change your mind. Despite coasting with the story, I personally found this to be engaging.",False

Jonathan D,True,2019-08-13,2.0,"Soooooo Lion King. Yeaaaaaa. I've got a rant with spoilers in the event that you've never seen the original. There's your warning....

The Lion King remake. What can I say about this movie other than it was super incredibly disappointing. More disappointing than any remake of anything in recent memory. 

Here's what is great. The casting was suuuuuuuuuper fantastic. Everyone sounded like the original cast. Whether that is intentional or just a happy circumstance, I don't care. Well done. Visuals? Impressive as ever. It looked how I imagine the Serengeti would look. Music? Also, well done. Very well done. With the exception of 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' We get it Beyonce. You have some pipes. You're still trash and I don't care what anyone says. Your music sucks and you almost destroy a song because you clearly want people to know you're a singer. FUCK OFF!

All right. Now that I've got the great stuff out of the way you're probably thinking I had a typo when I said it was disappointing. I didn't. Despite all of those things, it was missing the most important piece of what made this movie such a classic...EMOTION! There was no emotion displayed from any of these creatures during any given moment. The quintessential scene of Simba trying to get his dead father up should've gotten me, a 30 year old man, to bawl my eyes out on my tears. Not. One. Shred. Of. Sadness. The cartoon makes me misty eyed to this day. That's not a lie. This hyper realism should've done that and more. It didn't. 

Also, there were changes with certain scenes' dialogue that should never have been changed. The scene of Simba speaking to the spectre of Mufasa. Such a POWERFUL scene in the cartoon. Mufasa tells his son that he has lost himself. Moreover, because he lost himself he had therefore forgotten about his father, whom he (Simba) claims to love. It was a powerful scene that really enlightened Simba to the realization of the consequences of him trying to hide from what has happened and to hide from who really is. What did the remake do? Tell Simba that he needed to reclaim his place on the throne so he can reclaim his place in the Circle of Life. While not terrible, IT MISSES THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF CHARACTERIZATION FOR SIMBA. 

Jon Favreau is undoubtedly talented. I love Iron Man 1 obviously. The Jungle Book remake was perfect. While certain things were changed, they were changed well. THe Lion King is not an example of this. I had no emotional connection to ANY of these characters. I should have come out of this movie on CLOUD FUCKING 9 because of how much this movie means to me. Both, with the joy it brought to me as a youth and with an appreciation of the story being told when I reached adulthood. It saddens me. The cartoon is the best way to see this movie, undoubtedly. You can see the emotion of all the characters. The joy, the sadness, the disdain, the anger, everything. You don't get this with the remake. 1.75/5. I am truly sad to say this :(",True

Sharlene G,False,2019-08-12,2.0,"As much as I love Disney, this whole film just seemed off to me

I felt like I was watching a nature documentary that someone had added a voice over (but not well). It's like the voices didn't really gel with the creatures, and the audio levels never seemed to balance properly (sometimes too loud for the scene, other times too quiet, eg the character would be forefront but sound like they were in the distance, and in the distance but sound like they were beside you).
 
The characters were amazingly realistic....to the point that they were basically emotionless and therefore I didn't feel any connection with them.

Also...I know she's ""queen B"", but Beyonce really needs to learn that, in a duet, there's no lead - both voices need to blend together in unison. Instead, I felt like she was determined for her voice to be the star. In contrast, they made it a humour point when the actual star started riffing, which was clever, but then they were fine to have the supporting cast vocals over-power the lead..?

I was so looking forward to this film, but now that I've seen it, it's actually made me less excited for any of the future live action releases.",False

While they rightly portray a world of over-hunting large prey animals as unsustainable for predators, they counter that with presenting Paradise as a grub-eating world which couldn't support the large predators at all.  

Lion King II doesn't really improve the position.  It inserts this preachy ""straight line theory"" that shames the grub eaters as oblivious to the idea that everything is connected, While Still Presenting Their World As Paradise.  And making the animal-people ultra realistic only serves to make the idea of eating them even more difficult.

The movie is absolutely stunning to look at from start to finnish, nothing short but fantastic cinematography. The songs are all great, and amazing to watch on the big screen, my only complaint is the shortness of the song ""Be prepared""which could have been the single greatest song in the movie, but didn't quite make it, and it was Disney's fault for wanting it to be as different as possible from the original masterpiece. Yes, the emotions aren't displayed as greatly as in the original, but that's a given, and the voice acting and the phenomenal music accompanying the scenes make up for it. It would be a shame not to watch this movie, it truly is a great film, and watching the final battle between Scar and Simba, and watching all those great cinematic moments, such as 'circle of life' and surprisingly enough 'can you feel the love tonight' and my personal favourite 'can't wait to be king' is absolutely worth it.

There is a lack of any facial expression in the characters, as well as Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa look horrible. The characters are good, but that's only because it copied exactly what the original did, and unlike the original movie, the voice acting was pretty meh, exepect for Scar's voice who genuinely sucked. The songs are pretty awkward, as the musical ""numbers"" are just the characters running and don't even get me started on how cringe-worthy was ""Be Prepared"" here. It doesn't help that the voice actors (Beyonc√® aside) can't sing either.

4) two questions Simba was bipolar who changed his attitude in two seconds?  And if Nala knew where Simba was times ago, why didn't she go before him?

I feel bad even writing this because I do kind of cringe when things not related to a movie are brought in as a measure. That being said, I can't dismiss some of the small quirky moments of the animated film that really made it endearing. 

Whoopi's Mufasa shiver...I don't know how you would replicate it but that changes the whole atmosphere of the Hyenas. Simba getting knocked on the head. Classic moments. 

Simba's return seemed less impactful in this version. Didn't feel the struggle and importance of that decision like in the animated version. 

I didn't care for Donald Glover's rendition of Simba. One of the things about James Earl Jones is that is voice is so clear, he annunciates every syllable, he delivers with a fervent performance, he has power, clarity, and meaning. I didn't feel that with Mr. Glover. Fair comparison to anyone? Not really, but I didn't feel anything for his performance here. I feel really bad for anyone who has to sing opposite Beyonce.

Austin M,False,2019-08-09,2.5,"It lacked the emotion of the original and did not add enough new things to make it its own version.
The CGI looks pretty damn good but the fact it is using the look of real animals makes none of the characters show any emotion on their faces when they need it. With that thought, the voice work for those hard emotional scenes wasn't there either, Mufasa's death felt less impact full due to the actors lines not hitting right.
Some scenes were not emphasized on enough while others to much, such as the opening where we follow the little mouse, we dont need to follow it for a whole minute and a half, it adds nothing to the picture. While on the other hand the whole ""Be Prepared"" song number was basically gutted from the film and replaced with the last few lines being ""Talk Sung"" by Scar, another scene taken out, and probably one of the most important, being the scene where Rafiki gives his words of wisdom about learning from the past.

Hanny,True,2019-08-11,2.0,"It started out with some awesome scenery and shots of African wildlife.  However, the storytelling was labored and too predictable.  When you have an epic tale like Lion King, you cant just let it play out without an added point of interest either in the storyline or the characters.   I found the characters rather bland. Simba is not really resolving his feelings of guilt and the Hakuna Matata song does little to get the message across that a positive outlook can change anything.  Scar is given more screen time than necessary and the final battle between Simba and Scar goes on for far too long.  In fact long enough for my 12 year old grandson to start fidgeting and checking his watch to see when the end would come.  Nala is forgettable and so are most of the other characters with perhaps the exception of Zazu, the dodo bird.  The music left me cold and did nothing to bring back memories of the unforgettable live musical I so loved and enjoyed.",False

I understand their focus on trying to remain true to the cartoon, yet still make it its own movie and I think it was a fail. GREAT job on Aladdin, poor job on Loin King. Hopefully they stop here like they did with Aladdin. Which by the way I was very sad about. I would enjoy another Aladdin 2. I didn‚Äôt like the voices for all the characters except for mufasa and rafiki. Beyonc√© was ok a nala and I understand the idea of going with similar but yet different but it was a stretch. The lack of animal emotion was tough. I can imagine it being tough to make the movie move and act like real animals. I mean do animals really know how to laugh and joke and look said and show pain but that movie is one that needed it and lacked alittle. I do really appreciate james earl jones being able to be Mufasa. That‚Äôs a role only he could do. Would I go see it again. Definitely not. Aladdin I would but in the plus side, the previews made my wife and I interested in the maleficent movie. Good job!",False

Brian G,True,2019-08-08,4.0,"I enjoyed watching this movie on a visual and cinematic scale, but I honestly did not feel the magic that radiates from the original animated movie.

Distracted _,False,2019-08-08,4.0,I think it's a fun and inducing movie and a great remaster if the original Lion King. I like how Disney is remaking their old classics to appeal to the new generation of our audiences. I think they did a good job on the animation and almost all the animals looked realistic. One complaint I do have though is the audio. Disney used the original audio from the first movie which I think is a good choice it's just that Disney didn't remaster the audio. At some points it sounds like the audio was recorded on a $10 microphone rather than the new high-quality mics. The lip-syncing with the animation sometimes doesn't look good. I'm surprised that that happened because Disney is known for their masterful animation and how they try to make their movies as perfect as possible. Overall I think it's a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone in ages 7-mid 20s.,False
Rahul R,False,2019-08-08,3.0,"Clearly a complete cash grab. But ""live action"" animation doesn't do this film justice. The original was SO much better. I don't care much for cast when the animation itself lets the audience down.",False

Even my kids liked the original better, after watching both they picked the original.

At the beginning during the circle of life thats exactly what I wanted, but I feel like I watched the same movie Ive watched a hundred times remastered. It was beautiful, yes, but I was expecting some new surprises. The only thing that was really different was Spirit and it was just added to a scene that already existed. Actually, it wasnt as good because the realistic animation did not convey emotion like the animated version did. It was like a nature documentary with the original script over it. Also, Donald Glover cannot hold a note to save his life! Young Simba had a beautiful voice and once he grew up, it was like someone pressed the downgrade button too many times. Beyonc really carried the team in Can you Feel the Love Tonight. I wished there was more new surprises but at the end of the day, its the exact same as the original. It was still beautiful though.",False
Travis,True,2019-08-08,3.0,"While the computer animation was absolutely stunning (especially during the opening sequence), I longed for the charm and wit of the original. I will say that Chiwetel Efijor did a great job with Scar in this version, though it was less camp and more Shakespearean in comparison with the original. Im glad that James Earl Jones was able to reprise his role as Mufasa but was surprisingly underwhelmed by his performance. Not sure if it has to do with his advanced age now (88) but all things considered, I cant imagine anyone else playing that role. Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen did what they could as Timon & Pumbaa with some genuinely funny parts (especially the hilarious shout out to another Disney classic near the end). Would I see it again? Not likely, but it was a nice reminder of why the original will stand as one of (if not the best) animated movie of all time.",False

Growing up that was like my favorite villain song in all of Disney and they just took it all out. That was frustrating. Also at the end when timon did a beauty and the beast reference... that was horrible. You don‚Äôt reference another movie inside a make believe movie.

As if the voice actors were bored. I love Beyonc√©, but the minute she said,  ‚Äú Lions, Attack!!‚Äù made it all that more cheesy. Far, far, far, from the original.

Paul D,False,2019-08-08,3.5,"My kiddos and I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which we saw in the theater (though we opted against the 3d version).  There is no question that the special effects look real, as though there are live animals speaking and interacting with each other.  The kids particularly liked the comic routine of Pumba and Timon (yes, especially the farting!), and their various forest friends.  But what struck me about this movie was the extraordinary precision with which it hewed to the plot of its animated predecessor, with characters, scene, and sequence virtually identical (as well as the songs, which is understandable; and, I think, even the dialogue).  I'm going to look out for the extent to which other Disney live-action successors replicate their canonical referents.  It's probably best to interpret the virtual duplication as testimony to the power and interest of the original animated version and its new digital doppelganger.",False
Ann C,True,2019-08-08,4.0,"The animation and music were outstanding!
The only thing I found annoying was Nalad southern accent. It was a marked difference from that of the actor voicing Simba.

Really, there is a lot to admire about the movie, but still it can't escape the shadow of the original.  The weird thing is despite being longer a lot of times it feels like it's rushing through the beats of the original.  Most notably, Mufasa's death scene (spoiler's I guess) feels weirdly rushed.  I remember in the original there was time dwelling on Simba looking at the body and begging for Mufasa to get up.  Here, he just kinda looks at it, sniffles a bit, and the scene moves on.  Look I'm not saying it needs to be a shot for shot remake, but if you are going to go through the effort of doing the exact same scenes, either do them better, or do them at least as good, don't just rush through them to check off a box.  That's this films biggest flaw, and it really did bother me.  It lives under the shadow of the original often doing things because ""the original did it"" without really seeming to have an understanding of why that worked in the original.  It was different artists with different visions.  However, when it's doing it's own thing, it actually kinda' works.  A lots been made of Timon and Pumbaa in this movie, and rightfully so, they're one of the few things that is expanded and made to live on their own.  They're essentially the same sort of characters, but Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen bring their own personality to them.  They were allowed to improvise and give their own spin with new lines and humor.  They even have a new philosophy and debate on Hakuna Matata versus Circle of Life that's actually genuinely interesting.  I also liked how their home is inhabited by other animals and it shows how Simba became part of that community in his exile.  It's expansions like this where the film does its own thing where it really shines.  Yes the visuals are nice, but the animals don't show the personality like they did in the animation because Lions can't cry/smile/laugh in real life so what were left with is a really pretty Disney Nature CGI-fest.  It's these narrative moments that make the film work.  I ultimately give it a moderately positive review because‚Ä¶damnit it's still The Lion King, and yeah there were enough things it did right.

And to add insult to a classic scene. .  the iconic, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" scene, was played out in broad daylight; with Beyonce unleashing unbridled vocal runs over the classic song.  . A hot mess.

Kai H,False,2019-08-07,0.5,"The visuals in this movie are impressive. The photo realism is astounding, but that's not all this movie should've been. The story was a copy and paste of the original, much like a video game remake. The voice acting was subpar at some points. Some of the most influential scenes (Mufasas death, Scars musical number, Hakuna Matata) were dull and lifeless BECAUSE of the photo realism. The characters can't emote properly so some of the body movements are exaggerated, but then it gives the characters an uncanny valley vibe. One of the best Disney villain songs in my opinion was completely scraped and only had a hint of the original song towards the very end, but even then it wasn't there. Because this is photorealistic, there's no creativity. What should've been inspiration, was just there to be a template to animate over. The lack of facial expressions kills this whole movie. When Simba sees his father dead on the gorge floor in the original, he is so expressive and it makes you feel what Simba is feeling in that moment. In the remake, all of that emotion is lost. No expression, no emotion. If they were making this for a bunch of lions, I'm sure they'd be thankful for the accuracy, but the movie isn't for LIONS it's for HUMANS. Humans rely on facial emotion to properly understand what's happening. Animals (especially felines) don't. They rely on body language. But a lot of people can't read animals. That's why cats are seen as aloof and uncaring. Their owners can't read them. If people aren't able to read real life animals, how are they supposed to read the body language of an imitated animal? So many influential scenes were removed and so many tedious and useless characters were added (ie the animals in the jungle) all for the sake of a joke or a sixty second song. The scene with Mufasas ghost in the clouds was barely recognizable for me in theaters because all I saw was a bunch of clouds with the occasional lightning. When you take one of the worlds most known films and attempt a remake, you should improve on it. Don't try to change the formula. Leave some realistic elements in, but don't try to make it look like I just spent twenty bucks on a movie ticket to watch a National Geographic documentary. This movie was lifeless and a copy paste, but with better graphics. ",False

Story is the same with a longer run time but feels shorted also. They have longer shots some in some scene that feel like there just doing to kill time. While they have shorter more rushed dialoged in other scene. There is one noted new scene where you see Nala leave pride rock and some add time with Simba, Timon and Pumbaa. If you where thinking with the extra run time they would add more heart and soul the characters backround and story they don't. The songs do not even come close to the original. 'Cant wait to be king' is  just okay at best, they don't even try with Scar 'be prepared', and 'can you feel the love tonight' is just there. ",False

First of all, it drags on, there is a 40-50 minute long introduction that leads to the climax of the plot, and that is boring to death. Second, the animals are not anatomically accurate. Disney castrated them all, because God forbid kids see reproductive organs (eyeroll). Third, there is a lot of violence, very inappropriate for a family movie.

Joe B,True,2019-08-06,4.0,"The CGI is terrific, really the visuals are the main reason to go see the movie.  If you have already seen the animated version, you'll have a hared time finding what was added (this version runs 30mins longer than the original).  I really enjoyed the new voices for Timon (Billy Eichner), Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) and (John Oliver).  Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar seems more low-key (and menacing) than Alan Rickman's version, while the returning voice work of James Earl Jones as Mufasa was a welcome link to the original version.  The majority of the rest of the primary cast, including Donald Glover (Simba) and Alfre Woodard (Sarabi) is fine )maybe a bit underused), but the chemistry between Beyonce's Nala and Simba seemed off...

If you liked the original (unless you are a complete purist) you will find the ""live-action"" version of the Lion King an enjoyable show.  The new visuals are stunning, even if the story itself is not improved upon.",False

This movie has its moments of nostalgia, and the musical numbers are still effective, but as with Aladdin it just doesn't have anything new to say.

Jonathan B,True,2019-08-06,5.0,"It was a childhood classic, brought a lot of good memories.",False
George R Rodriguez Jr,True,2019-08-06,3.0,"The positive: Captivating graphics, True to the original storyline, not the exact same script so the sounds were condenced and there wasnt as much talk when there didnt need to be.

What was missing: Dispite stunning graphics it was odd, even creepy to watch seemingly lifelike character emotionless and apparently not even breathing. To clarify, the animals only movement was a result of the animators trying to capture the effects of wind hitting their bodies or their movement from one position to the next. The act of breathing which everyone creature does at rest or in motion was only present in the field mouse and possibly 2 or 3 times in Simba. The creatures almost emotionless features left a great deal to the character actors to create in tone of their voices. 

So this movie sadly rated 3 stars since I expected much more. Hard to believe a cartoon version back in 1994 told the story better and demanded more emotional presence that all viewers were in tears. It would have been an even trade-off if the 2019 version kept the same script word for word, atleast that way the viewers could resite scenes along with the movie.",False

Quite frankly, it's very disappointing that a proclaimed movie critic would give this movie such a low rating. For one, this movie is NOT to be compared to the original. Lions with facial expressions make it very appealing to the younger audience. However, this movie is life changing and a huge leap in the movie industry. Of course, they won't give a virtually real looking lion eyebrows that leave their face. It is up to the audience to listen and experience in order to get a feel for what this movie is expressing. Yes, that means use your own imagination. The Lion King has opened so many doors and it's hard to think of an new animated movie that could possible beat this one. Everything was fantastic. A lot of critics will say that they left out important messages that the original movie inputted. However, by watching, laughing, sympathizing, and gaining a connection through this experience does anything but lack those messages.

blockbusterbuff,True,2019-08-06,1.5,"LION KING REMAKE review:

Once this movie ended, one of my friends leaned over to me and said, ‚ÄúWELL THAT WAS A LIFELESS CORPSE OF A MOVIE.‚Äù Honestly, he‚Äôs not that far off.

This remake is ‚Äúlive action‚Äù, which ironically takes the life out of it. üòÇ It feels like a computer made this movie, both literally and metaphorically! ü§£ 
Donald Glover plays Simba, and I‚Äôm sorry, I LOVE Glover, but he is so miscast. Honestly, all the voice actors sounds so uninterested & tired, it sounds like they all took half a bottle of NyQuil before recording. üòù

Some things don‚Äôt work in live action. These animals seem so robotic, & there‚Äôs no emotion on any of their faces! üòê I think a brick wall had more emotion than these f*cking characters‚Äô faces. üòÇ .

All these Disney remakes are the same, goddamnit! They‚Äôre all wildly MEDIOCRE, with little charm or life to them, and only exist to show off pretty visuals and to make money lazily.
Then again, it was at least funny to watch my friend right next to me get really MAD in the theater. üòÇ",True

Ed B,True,2019-08-06,3.0,"If Disney used the original audio (cast and songs) of the animated film in this visually stunning film, then I would have rated it five stars. Unfortunately, the new cast lacks the energy - most notably Scar and Timon - of the original film. Additionally, Beyonc over sings her songs, forgetting that it is an ensemble film not a concert. Lastly, a few key scenes, moments and language have been removed and replaced with ""non-offending"" dialogue.",False
Alecks H,False,2019-08-06,0.5,"This remake was too pathetic and cheap. I have to say, the artisty of using CGI was pretty darn good, but having pretty pictures and animation to almost lifelike characters and scenes wasnt enough to save this movie. The voice over of the animals made it seem more fake than anything, and seriously,¬† this was an animated movie in 1994 there was really a lack of expression and character from start to finish. If disney¬† is going to remake such an iconic movie such as The Lion King at least try and make it decent and not like a children's documentary movie with poorly talking animals and dull expressions. Nevertheless the story was more to the original Hamlet, which definitely shows disney takes the hard work of others and spins it off for their entertainment and financial benefit.

Tonya R,False,2019-08-06,3.5,"The Lion King 2019 film version. Where to start, where to start. The animation? Orgasmic, like multiple and squirting.

I felt the burning need to jump up and make out with Donald Glover's Simba more often than I care to admit. That shit was w-e-t. They managed to squeeze a little heaven, a.k.a Beyonc√©, in there, while the annoying Brit, John Oliver, plays the annoying British bird. So give that casting director a raise! The soundtrack? More cinematic than it was before because the only thing better than percussion is more percussion. The story? Unchanged, but ain't nothin' higher than #1, to quote Beyonc√©'s husband. Timon and Pumbaa have new jokes, Chiwetel Ejiofor tries to sing ""Be Prepared,"" bless him, while James Earl Jones and Mufasa officially become one light. I am missing Nala's smug feminist journey, Simba's Transformation is too dialed in like a 1-900 number, and if you're gonna hire John Kani to play the red-assed Rafiki you give the man some more work because he's everything.

This might be sacrilege, but I never saw the original, so I can't compare.

The visuals were really outstanding and mesmerizing.  There were times I struggled to tell if it was real or not.  

In terms of the actors, I thought Seth Rogan was pretty strong.  Beyonce was my second favorite.  Donald Glover (as Simba) was OK but didn't really stand out to me.

Overall I enjoyed it.

The cgi visually was amazing, it really felt like you were watching a documentary.That being said i felt the realism was what let the film down, missing the facial expressions and emotions from the original.

The music of course is what made the lion king great ! But again you can't not compare it to the original which of course is better .

Apparently there was 30 minutes more added to this remake which I rarely noticed when watching the film except for when they threw in a bit of Beyonc√© just to fit in her new song .

Overall kids that are just being introduced to Disney will love it and the adults going with them will enjoy the nostalgia factor that made them love the original.

 The voice actors did their jobs , withh Seth Rogen and Beyonce standing out amongst the cast, and The Neptunes & Elton John did spectacular remixes to a soundtrack that never knew it needed a touch up.
There was a comic book adaptation of this that enjoyed reading above all retellings of this story , but Favreau's reboot of this stroy is in a class of it's own by sheer visual effects alone so much so that all interpretations of this film that came before don't even deserve to be put in comparison.

,False,2019-08-05,2.0,"I don't understand why they took out so many good things about the original movie. That plus, rushed dialouge, (felt like they (even James Earl Jones!) were reading a script for some of the old good dialouge) too loud music during a couple major dialouge scenes, way too much screen time for the mouse Scar was planning to eat and Simba's hair floating to Rafiki. And how did he know it was Simba's? It had touched water, a giraffe's tongue and dirt; I don't know how it would have still held Simba's scent. And it's just a piece of hair, not his hair all over the grass and flowers like in the original. How did he know who it was just by a look? Nala also recognized Simba way too fast! And though the lions were real-looking and beautiful, it took away from the emotion. Young Simba's crying and yet I see no tears and see no sadness on his face, so it took away from some of the emotional scenes. Minor note but Mufasa roared on the cliff scene. I preferred the original where his scream and roar was combined when Scar clawed him. It was also hard to tell the difference between Sarabi and Nala. A couple minor changes, a couple added lines to Scar and Timon and Pumbaa were good, but nothing spectacular. I couldn't see Mufasa in the sky. With all the special effects, I thought that would have been at least like the original, maybe better. Rafiki calls his stick his old friend, yet we never saw it in the beginning. He wasn't funny and silly, and he kept speaking in a different language which was confusing and not needed. And they took out him hitting Simba on the head! That was needed for Simba to change his mind and had a great moral lesson! And last but not least, they cut Be Prepared, one of the best songs ever made by Disney!! I understand why they did because the original is condescending to the hyena pack and they were a lot creepier and more aggressive in this version. But they could have done the song so much better. They shouldn't have even bothered making it if they were gonna do it like this. No need. Usually Disney does a great job, (like Aladdin. Those changes made sense and it was really live action, real people!) but unfortunately, they didn't live up to the original, not even close. ",False

Beyonc√© voice pulled me away from the move, her voice is to recognizable and she didn‚Äôt try to mask or change it, so every time she had a line it felt like I was listening to Beyonc√© and not Nala....it was the same with Seth rogen and the warthog. When it comes to CGI and animation I think it‚Äôs important to have a voice that‚Äôs not recognizable because you start to reference the voice to the actual person which ruins the movie or at least have the actor mask or change they‚Äôre voice.

Having that in mind I wasn't, like most, particularly excited about this remake nor was I expecting anything extraordinary. And I would be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. Yes, the story is completely recycled from the 1994 original almost shot-for-shot but that wasn't a big problem for me. I would recommend seeing this film if only to witness the stunning CGI on display here. It's genuinely photorealistic -  I might as well had been watching a Nat Geo documentary in that theater. I also have to mention the voice work of Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon & Pumba. The stars of this movie as far as I'm concerned. Perfect casting. The jokes never fall flat and I found myself truly laughing on more than one occasion. Donald Glover suprisingly delivers an underwhelming performance as adult Simba. Almost emotionless most of the time. I was also glad to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasa once again, always great in his iconic role. However, the pacing of the movie felt a bit off, almost as if it was rushed. That made me feel a bit detached from the story and I found myself not really caring much about the characters nor was the ending as cathartic as in the original. It's a 3.5 for me.",False

This wasn't a typical boisterous disney affair, yes there were appropriately fast paced moments and definitely some scarier chase and fight scenes, but the quiet moments were not rushed or littered with overacting or gratuitous potty humor..

I was a little disappointed, with the original being my favorite Disney film. However, the actors who replaced the originals do an amazing job in their characters.

When getting into nitpick territory I would only suggest that Jeremy Irons should have returned in the role of Scar.  That would be the only thing from making this a 5/5.

Geeg,True,2019-08-04,4.0,I loved the idea of the live action. It honestly made me even cry more because it felt real. It was not only sentimental to the original but it was also funny and had its moments. The orignal songs were great to listen to and brought up many childhood memories. But Beyonc√©‚Äôs song Spirit was a nice touch to the movie. The little scenes such as when Simba was chasing the beetle and when him and Mufasa had their talk it was just great and gave me the feels.

Ross E,False,2019-08-04,2.0,"The benefit this film has is that its following a story that was already good and familiar, so as you're watching, its helps keep the pace moving along as key scenes from the original play out. I wish I could see this movie without that advantage. Would it still carry well? Possibly, it's still a strong story, but I feel the real problem is the lack of emotion in the new portrayals, both in the voices as well as the lack of expression in the faces. Even James Earl Jones sounds tired and bored. Also, with songs as popular as these, every nuance sticks out. Kid Simba is basically lacking in emotion entirely both speaking and singing, new Zazu doesn't even ATTEMPT to be fun and interesting, kid Nala sounds like she's reading off her script, or at best maybe had one chance to read it over before delivering lines. Ugh and Timon and Pumba make Hakuna Matata a cringefest (as was Just can't Wait to be King). It really makes me wonder if these are good songs without the influence of the original. I generally enjoy covers when theyre done well, but I can't help but cringe at these attempts. 

To conclude my review, its only not awful because I'm watching the original in my head and overlaying it over this. Also, butchering Be Prepared wasn't the answer. I'd rather it be gone entirely than have what they did.",False

With some voice actors, it sounded like they recorded the first table read of the script.

Handpatter,True,2019-08-04,5.0,I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that they would have a Lion King preview before the Lion King movie. I am the type of person that refuses to watch previews due to wanting to be surprised.

Daniel S,False,2019-08-04,1.5,"I'm not usually ever bored in movies, and even if they're bad I can enjoy hating them, but this was just boring and lazy from start to finish.  The CGI looks great, but when the animals look so real it strips the characters of the humanity that can only be expressed in cartoon animation.  Every single moment of this movie was several steps below the original to the point where it was frustrating to watch.  It felt like every actor was phoning it in, even James Earl Jones, who was delivering the same lines as he did before, just worse somehow.  This movie was too long and yet felt like everything was rushed down to a high school first time table-read.  The only good thing about this movie by a long shot was John Oliver as Zazu who did a really good job and I enjoyed any moment he was on screen; perfect for the part.  Scar's voice and lines were by far the most disappointing. I could never think of a situation in which I would watch this instead of the original.",False

This adds absolutely nothing, also, the guy playing Scar clearly phoned in his performance, at no point coming close to conveying any emotion that wasnt mild disinterest. This wasnt helped by the fact that the CGI just cannot emote. Simba's ""I Just Cant Wait To Be King"" face is exactly the same as his ""Dad, why wont you wake up?"" Face.

In short, it's similar to James Cameron's ""Avatar:"" Praised for its stunning visual achievements but will soon be forgotten because there is nothing else that truly makes it stand out from any of the other films we've seen.

The acting was not very good. Singing voices of cub Simba and Nala were beautiful. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel the sound, exciting energy and humor of the original just wasn‚Äôt there.

It's almost a frame by frame remake, and while the actors and visual effects artists did great, the script writers were lazy, and many lines were just reused from the original.

Daniel O,False,2019-08-03,2.5,"A beautiful ""national geographic"" film that tries and fails to trigger the inner child and long-lasting connection many of us have had with the film. It definitely did not live up to the original.

The original animated film is a classic. A cliche story with great music, fun animations, and even brings a tear to your eye. 

However, the live action feel is way too close to reality. The animals look real, and it makes me feel uncomfortable to see them talk, sing and dance. The songs feel like they were cut short, the classic moments feel forced, and while it did pass the time, I cannot say that I enjoyed it.

There was no way to see emotion (a tear, a smile, etc...) on the faces of the real animals which really took away from the film.",False

Go watch a animal documentary and lipsync the voice on the animals, you'll have the same level of interest.

Positives are the visuals which are outstanding, and Timon and Pumba are by far the best characters of the movies.

Two B,False,2019-08-03,1.0,"Without a doubt the best movie Disney has ever made so far. It teaches you about the meaning of life, self awareness, true potential and overcoming your past. A beautiful master piece carefully crafted. And yet, this version fell so short. Why Disney keeps stomping on the things that we love and care about?

The characters were awful, Simaba is more reckless, weak and scary cat than it was before and Nala is more obnoxious, I used to love Nala because she was the anchor of Simba she was that little support and self awareness that Simba needed, now she's more like an obnoxious whip that never stops. 

In this version most of the comic relieves were removed or changed for something else,  this is disheartening because these scenes were part of the core of the movie, I remember when I was a little kid the hyenas made laugh so hard, here they removed most of their scenes so no laugh anymore. 

The music was great though. I still feel goosebumps when listening to ""Can you feel the love tonight"" and ""The circle of life""; beautiful music in deed, and I believe the movie has some of the best songs a movie can have.

I actually liked the original better.   It‚Äôs not enough just to redo it.   The reboot has to top the original or expand it.  This movie did neither.

Matt R,False,2019-08-02,2.5,"The original Lion King is SACRED to me. It is the movie that represents my childhood. Even now, 25 years later, I still get choked full of emotion watching it. But as I watched the, quote-on-quote ""live-action"" remake, I felt pretty much NOTHING. 

When Mufasa died (SPOILER ALERT), I felt NOTHING. 

When Simba roared to become king, I felt NOTHING. 

The film completely lacks the emotional depth of the original, and we're left with little more than a soulless shot-for-shot remake of the animated masterpiece. Granted, the visuals are spectacular, and the CGI is great, but this is that rare occasion where that is a bad thing. The animals look far too real to express any real form of emotion, which was my biggest concern going into this movie. 

The voice cast is solid, with Seth Rogen (Pumbaa) and Billy Eichner (Timon) stealing the show. They were even nice enough to bring back James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa. Unfortunately, that was the only returning member of the original voice cast, which I feel was a mistake. Chiwetel Ejiofor was an AWFUL replacement for Jeremy Irons as Scar, and the way the movie butchers the song ""Be Prepared"" is simply mind-boggling. The rest of the songs are perhaps the highlight of the film, providing you with a rush of nostalgia, most notably in the ""Circle of Life"" opening. To be honest, that may have actually been my favorite scene in the movie.

Nobody wanted a remake of The Lion King, which was already perfect in its original form. The only reason for this movie's existence is to be a quick cash grab, which Disney has gotten in the form of over a billion dollars and counting. For me, I've officially had enough of these cheaply made live-action remakes. Perhaps these films will resonate with this current generation of kids, and that's OK. The question now is whether or not it comes at the expense of mine.",False

Cece O,False,2019-08-02,1.5,"I originally walked into the theater hoping that I'd get a new take on a childhood classic. I had watched the movie many times as a child for it was my brother's favorite movie, and based on how Disney had rewritten the stories for this new age of live-action remakes (such as Maleficent not being as evil, and the side story in Dumbo) I had high hopes and high expectations. However, Disney did NOT meet up to those expectations. 

First off, the voice acting was not good, most notable in Beyonce's work. While I love Queen Bee, I detested her voice acting, and I'm quite sick of actual talented voice actors being replaced by A-List Celebrities just for the star quality to use in promotions to push out the movie and gain more money. Evidently, Disney values quantity over quality (not that I didn't already know this).

For the movie being a complete remake of the original without any new focus or plot-line, I at least expected it to be better, but it wasn't. The song sequences in the original were dull in the movie due to the lack of vibrant colors and stunning animation, and I was not very fond of the singing either. This was a definite complaint in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' and 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'. There was simply too much riffing for it to be enjoyable (for me at least) and while the singers are talented, I just wasn't into the style of singing compared to Disney's simpler yet powerful music- where the singers shows their prowess in the power of their voice rather than in how much they can riff notes (again, I was mostly annoyed with Beyonce). It turned from a sing-a-long tune to a listen-and-appreciate song, which was not something I wanted from such a staple like 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'. 

Most egregious, however, was the fact that they CUT SCAR'S VILLIAN SONG! IT WAS LIKE THIRTY SECONDS! WTF!? IT MIGHT NOT BE A 'HELLFIRE', BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD, AND THE ANIMATION SEQUENCE FOR IT IN THE ORIGINAL WAS SO AMAZING WITH THE GREEN TINT AND EVERYTHING, UGH!

The only thing that was an improvement was the comic relief characters Timon and Pumbaa, and I wouldn't mind getting a Lion King 1 1/2, as long as they were just as funny.

I suppose the movie would be good for the new generation that can't compare it to the original (but I'd most certainly never let my little cousins watch this before feasting on the beauty that was 1994's Lion King), but for older viewers like me (lol, I'm only seventeen), DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. The original Lion King's on Netflix now, just watch it there.

Kyle M,False,2019-08-02,4.5,"If you could think which Disney classic seems to be more of a masterpiece, taking it further on a majestic scale, ""The Lion King"" would arguably come to mind as the most outstanding animated presentation ‚Äì with questionable origin, while Jon Favreau's reimagined ""The Jungle Book"" takes the top podium for the live-action medium. The obvious connection between the two films is Favreau's ambition of exploiting the amazing technological effects that brought ""The Jungle Book"" to life, with blended vie for faithfulness that marks his authorship, and ""The Lion King"", being Disney's Renaissance peak, is another nature film with a legendary stance that makes it a perfect challenge to tackle in another reimagining. The remake does not exactly reach the mighty volume but is without a doubt generally beautiful and honorably triumphant.

""The Lion King"", marking the 25th anniversary of the original majesty, is agreeably inferior but nonetheless great from the scenic imagery masking authentic natural wonders as the definite counterpart form of photorealism to the overall soul consisting the musical score and vocal performances. The kinetic energy between the CGI-created environment and the mostly new cast bringing their connected characters to life is what makes the onscreen appearances as perfect embodiments, indicating how utterly faithful Favreau passionately honored without ruining the formulaic greatness. With a lot of iconic aspects that could not be completely revised nor flipped whilst still the same narrative touch in the flow, he still obliged with the current traditional routine of modernizing meanings, differentiating insights and originated intentions that were more pointed out towards the classic with very little to improve. The story is Shakespearean through ""Hamlet"", and Favreau pushed the story closer to its original source material.

However, the film is mostly criticized for being more of a shot-for-shot remake without adding anything new to the whole story. While that may be true unlike how the past remakes enhanced the experience with updated storytelling and opportune positions for character arcs that were not thought of at the time,  and there are only little expansion in the script's subtle heftiness, it is rather proof that the story can still be told under a new aesthetic with the same enjoyment value ‚Äì like how praiseworthy remakes did when reusing the formula. As the main intention is to honor the story, Favreau explored it dimensionally albeit being at times questionably disruptive in contrast to the original's smoothness, and the effects adds little more depth such as the expressions when emotions are expressed.

One element that pleasantly remains the same between the two is the music with composer Han Zimmer reprising his role in spiritually lifting the story's spirit once again, revitalizing the circle of life. The opening number, presented by the franchise's collaborative performer Lebo M featuring Rafiki theatrical performer Lindiwe Mkhize, gives the film's first impression with an ever-chilling effect as it amplifies the scene ‚Äì and given the background information shows the faithful lengths that were pursued.

The Broadway-equivalent fine cast has lent their voices to the beloved, memorable characters with matching yet refreshing spirit including the update's more modernized tone. James Earl Jones' return as Mufasa is an awesome touch in revisiting the Pride Lands with the mightily classic guidance. The rest of the cast, becoming part of the challenging retelling, did exceptionally well in their performances, with some proudly matching the original voices as a step further of doing their part in honoring the legacy's initial characterization. The only flaw is not making up for agreeing in shorthand to follow the disruptive flow on very few, noticeable occasions.

Jon Favreau triumphs in successfully tackling the ambitious challenge of remaking a classic, while enforcing photorealism as another masking medium for filmic storytelling and again demonstrating faithful lengths in really connecting to the story while honoring it. He did just that in exploring the circle of life in a way he wanted to tell it, despite being more flawed than his previous jungle expedition that was only groundbreaking and additionally hefty. ""The Lion King"" may not roar as mighty nor in a majestic fashion to the king's royal level, the undemanding remake successfully and perfectly naturally replicated the epic power to bolster the entertainment value in being noted as this year's best live-action remake from the brand, with beauty and honor.

I thought until I read otherwise today that the landscapes were all location shots & characters then digitally inserted. I had no idea the entire thing save one shot was digitally rendered. The knocks on it are legit: there's just not as much vibrancy & life as the original. You can't recreate those colorful, coordinated animations digitally. But it makes up for it by bringing to life an awesome story. You forget the animals aren't real. It's remarkable. Probably won't rent or purchase on demand but will watch when it comes on TNT later.

Ryan F,False,2019-08-02,1.5,"The only reason I'm giving this movie 1.5 stars is because of the impressive visuals. Otherwise, not only was this remake completely devoid of the heart & soul of the original, it also grossly lacked the humor of the original. And I'm not only talking about Pumbaa & Timon, it also severely lacked what Cheech Marin & Whoopi Goldberg brought to the hyenas. This movie is nothing more than a blatant cash grab in between Avengers movies",False
,False,2019-08-04,2.0,"The main issue with this movie is that it cannot decide whether it‚Äôs a frame by frame remake, or a serious toned adaptation. It‚Äôs both when it shouldn‚Äôt be. Favreau absolutely nailed the dichotomy of the two styles in Jungle Book and simply failed in Lion King. The Jungle Book has believability when Baloo sings to himself/Mogli while floating the river. King Louis doesn‚Äôt sing when he‚Äôs confronting Mogli and the scene is immensely more terrifying and believable. I wasn‚Äôt scared of Scar when he ‚Äúsang‚Äù Be Prepared. I didn‚Äôt feel whimsical at Can‚Äôt Wait to be King. Honestly the best musical segment was Lion Sleeps tonight because it provided some comical relief and built itself naturally. Speaking of poor music choices, Lion King 2019 had the opportunity to truly marry the beloved animated film with the beloved broadway musical and just...didn‚Äôt. The available soundtrack even has several songs from the broadway show, yet the film does not use them. Instead of ‚ÄúHe Lives in You‚Äù we have Beyonc√© singing ‚Äúspirit‚Äù over and over. Rather than ‚ÄúShadowlands‚Äù, we have...‚ÄùBe Our Guest?‚Äù The Beauty and the Beast reference was completely out of place and really took away from the scene. Lastly, although the animation is beautifully done, Favreau dug his heels in on the realism. The magnificent color pallet and character design/humanism in the original animated film is replaced with emotionless hyper-realistic animals and sets. No longer the rich and dramatically colorful landscapes and emotive characters, but more of the dry earth tones and expressionless animals. Any wildlife documentary does a better job of highlighting Africa‚Äôs immense beauty and diversity. I can understand Favreau‚Äôs desire to cater to the nostalgic audience, but it feels, again, like he couldn‚Äôt decide what movie he wanted to make. Was it a frame by frame remake or was is a serious toned adaptation with small tributes to the source material? Yes. ",False

Andy G,False,2019-08-02,4.5,"This is tricky to rate. I heard one person explain it very well ""It's like you're enjoying the movie, but also bored at the same time"". I give it points for the visual technology, for the score, for the cinematography, and some of the acting, but overall there's just a feeling that it's lacking the soul it needs, because they decided to make the animation just a little too realistic, where the animals simply are expressionless, and it hurts the movie.

I don't know why they took that approach. It's been proven before that realistic models/lighting/materials can mesh very well with a slightly more cartoony animation. In fact, some of the best animation I've ever seen has been done that way, and this movie would have been improved if they handled things that way. Take a look at Rocket Raccoon for a relevant recent example of a mostly photorealistic animal that animates properly. Even The Jungle Book handled this better. 

It's still mostly an enjoyable experience, because I mean, it's still the Lion King, but with the obvious comparisons you're going to make, even a decently made movie is still going to feel underwhelming compared to a practically flawless original. So yes, my words may seem at odds with my rating, but overall, this was still a well made movie. It just didn't live up to the bar it needed to hit.",False

Micah W,False,2019-08-02,1.5,"Man... where do I start with this one... I came into this film hearing both good things about the film from friends and bad things from critics, so I tried to keep an open mind, but this one was really quite a disappointment. While I can tell that a lot of hard work was put into this movie, as a whole, it just failed in so many ways. In case you haven't heard, the new Lion King is very closely followed to that of a shot to shot remake. There are some subtle differences to the film, but nearly all of them are much more for worse than for better. While there are some problems I have with the idea of a shot to shot remake, I wouldn't mind it too much if they had kept the heart of the original intact. However, they didn't and that can be broken down into 2 main reasons. 

(1). The Cinematography. What I'm about to say may not make sense at first, but bear with me. I truly believe that some absolutely amazing work was done in terms of the visual effects for this film. So much time and effort was put in from this department and it shows in its realism (even if it does cross into the uncanny valley occasionally). However, despite this fact, the movie is so visually boring. Sure, the visual effects of the film may look realistic, but that doesn't mean they look good from an artistic perspective. Everything is just so dull looking and anticolorful. Sure it looks like I'm watching a documentary, but it's a documentary that contains flat, boring shots that do nothing to show off the beauty of Africa. If you want visuals like that, go watch Planet Earth. That movie is stunning! Compare the visuals of the remake to that of the animated original. Because the original isn't hindered by its ideology that it has to look as realistic as possible, it has the creative freedom to exaggerate. To do things that you just couldn't without it being animated. One scene, in particular, was that of ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"". In the original, as soon as the music hits, the animation changes and the world becomes gorgeously colorful. The whole scene is Simba and Nala interacting with all the animals in fun and creative ways that make for a joyous time. Contrast to the original and its both of them running around the watering hole trying to hide from Zazu. Nothing special. The problem with the choice of making it look like a documentary is that it adds restrictions to the film that the original could ignore and run wild with! The visual style may look realistic for the most part, but that doesn't mean it looks good.

(2).The performances. I have to first off preface this by stating that I in no way believe that any the actors in this film are bad actors. On the contrary, there is a whole lot of voice-talent in this film! However, what we hear is only half of what we get when it comes to performances in a film like this. That other half of the performances was that of the facial expressions. ESPECIALLY the ones pertaining to any of the lion characters. I know this goes back a little to the previous point I made, but the idea of making this film look hyperrealistic hurt this film in so many ways! Because they decided that these lions need to look and act as realistic as possible, they dumbed down their facial expressions to the point that you can barely tell what any of them are thinking. It merely looked like voices dubbed poorly over nature documentary footage. Imagine seeing an actor sound like they are truly crying and balling as they stare at the lifeless body of their father with eyes that only seem mildly upset. That is what watching this film was like. I could never take any of these performances seriously despite the talent behind these voices. Even James Earl Jones sounded bored in this movie!! The only real exceptions to this in the film were from Timon and Pumba. They were hilarious! They were allowed to be different and the animation used for them allowed the expressiveness in their voice to actually come out and shine. 

There were many other problems I had with the film (i.e. theme removal, incredibly rushed scene pacing, ""Be Prepared"" is shortened to a sloppy mess, and WAY too many riffs from Beyonce and Donald Glover), but these two points were the main ones that stuck out to me.",False
James S,False,2019-08-02,2.0,"The CGI was great, but that destroyed a lot of the emotion the cast was trying to show the audience. There is no point in watching this movie if you have access to the original 1994 Lion King. ",False

Viewers may or may not enjoy the cartoonish comical feel that is lost when the film has more of a dramatic and slightly stoic flow.

Rafiki didn‚Äôt even have his stick and never hit Simba with it COME ON..... the you would think the people that they cast for the hyenas would at least try to improvise something funnier than the final product that was presented.

Suhanara B,False,2019-08-01,1.0,"If I could give this film a solid 0 stars I would. How dare they ruin my childhood movie to that extent. Oh boy this is gonna be a long one. 
1. They took out all the funniest bits of the original animated movie. How can you take out all of the most loved funny bits, for example the hyenas. Their laughs and how stupidly funny they were in the animated version there was nothing like that in this re make movie it was boring dull and way too serious. 
2. Although the original voice actor who played Mufasa came back for this remake movie I was absolutely disappointed in his  performance. His  dialogue were similar to the animated version but in no way was said with the same enthusiasm and seriousness, it was just boring and very dull. 
3. I enjoyed Nothing about this movie all I could do was shake my head during it all 
My advice would have been to keep to the same dialogue as the original. You've ruined it for us all 90's kids who grew up watching the lion king. I had great hopes for this remake sadly I'm very disappointed!!!!! ",False

baylie o,True,2019-08-01,3.0,"Visually beautiful but not terribly emotional. I just didn't feel invested in any of the characters, and didn't sense the tension that I did in the animated version. Maybe because I already knew how it would end?",False

Unlike the excellent live action Aladdin 2019 movie, that both nailed the original story, added new storylines, and found its own voice, this movie is a bland by the numbers almost shot for shot CG redo. It's CG is interesting and impressive to see once, but after that give me the original anyday.",False

Tina,True,2019-08-01,4.5,"I honestly didn't like Beyonce as Nala the voice just didn't fit. Though I do love Beyonce as an artist. Also, did not like how they added the Beauty and Beast song Be Our Guest in it, the original song was way better for that part. Other than that I truly enjoyed it.",False
Will M,False,2019-08-01,2.0,"I truly enjoyed the original Lion King, it deserves all the attention it gets. I was cautious as I entered the theater to see the latest Disney live action remake, although nothing in the film is not entirely computer generated. But I was hopeful, I wanted to enjoy this movie. Directed by Jon Favreau? I love Iron Man, and even the live-action Jungle Book! I will start with the pros. First and foremost, the VFX. This is probably the most photorealistic CGI I have ever seen in any movie ever, and I say that with confidence. I cannot imagine how long it took to animate this film. The casting was pretty good. I thought it was a smart move to hire James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa a second time, because, let us be honest, that guy is irreplaceable! Donald Glover as Simba, Beyonc√© as Nala, John Oliver as Zazu, were really good. I think the best voice performance, though, was Seth Rogen as Pumba. Now for the cons. Being a shot for shot remake, you know exactly what is going to happen, when it is going to happen, how it is going to happen, and so forth. The remake of Beauty And The Beast, which I also disliked, was shot for shot as well, but they sprinkled it with a few new songs, new scenes, and some dialogue alterations. The Lion King, on the other hand, the original has more scenes than this. They have shortened this movie by at least twenty minutes. Remember Be Prepared in the original? In this, the song is less than thirty seconds. Also, some of the characters do not have a fraction of the charm as they did in the original. For example, Rafiki is wise, but a bit of a joker in the original. In this, he is just wise. Even Scar is not as intimidating as he was. Another thing, being as photorealistic as it is, the characters cannot make facial expressions. Since the original was a cartoon, they could smile, frown, cry, scream, and gasp. Realistically speaking, a Lion cannot do any of those things. So when they talk, they look like they are simply opening their mouths, and this flaw is sometimes laughable. The biggest flaw, however, is that this movie has absolutely no reason to exist. There is not one thing wrong with the original, so why remake this if there is nothing that can be improved upon?

In short, this was the first movie I have ever seen in an acttheater that bored me to the point to where I longed for the credits to roll.",False

Alex,True,2019-08-01,4.0,"Matched up with the original animated version as well as could have been. Animation wasn‚Äôt the best. I feel they could have fine tuned the lionesses better to make them look more realistic. The male lions looked more real for some reason. The characters mouth movement was slightly off and I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the cast chosen to play the characters, I get it you had to pick people that could sing. But hearing Beyonc√© talk for the mala was annoying shes too soft spoke for that role. Other than that I‚Äôm very pleased with the end result üôÇ",False

Sean C,False,2019-08-01,1.5,"The ""Live-Action"" (photo-realistic) remake of Disney's classic, The Lion King, was unnecessary. It was visually stunning, but fails to capture the raw emotion and heart of the original animated version. There were a couple of issues I had with the live-action remake. First, 3/4's of the film sounded like the actors phoned in their lines.  An exception to this is the musical number, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight,"" which sounds like Beyonce Knowles and Donald Glover were actually in the studio. Second, there were a surprising amount of lines, musical numbers, and jokes that were cut from the live-action remake that was in the original animated film. The previous, coupled with the lack of facial expressions from the photo-realistic animals, made the film feel hollow and dull. Lastly, I was unimpressed by the amount of energy, life, and charisma the acting cast put into the characters. Especially Chiwetel Ejiofor who played a very flat Scar (I missed the sassy, sarcastic drama-king version that Jeremy Irons portrayed). The exceptions to this are James Earl Jones (Mufasa), Billy Eichner (Timon), and Seth Rogen (Pumbaa). The skit where Timon starts singing ""Be Our Guest"" from Disney's, Beauty and The Beast, was terrific and hilarious.",False
